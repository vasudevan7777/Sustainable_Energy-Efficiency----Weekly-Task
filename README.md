ENERGY EFFICIENCY PREDICTIONS IN BUILDINGS - WEEK 1


📌 Overview
This project is about predicting the energy efficiency of buildings.
In Week 1, the main goal is to explore the dataset and understand how building features (like wall area, roof area, glazing area, etc.) affect heating and cooling loads.
